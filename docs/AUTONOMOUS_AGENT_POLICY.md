## 🤖 Autonomous Agent Policy & Escalation Ladder (DEFINITIVE)

This policy defines the strict boundaries, file allowlists/denylists, and mandatory escalation process to ensure auditable, minimal, and safe code changes.

### Decision Escalation Ladder (How the AI may expand scope)

#### Mode 0 — Normal (Default)

- **Description**: Standard bug fix or feature implementation tied to an issue number.
- **Scope Rules**:
  - **Allow**: `app/**`, `src/**`, `tests/**`, `docs/**`.
  - **Deny**: All root configs, dependencies, and CI.
- **Action**: Proceed immediately.

#### Mode 0.5 — Self-Initiated Refactor

- **Description**: Used for small, beneficial technical debt reduction (e.g., dead code removal, small type-cleanup) not tied to an existing issue.
- **Scope Rules**:
  - Must NOT include adding/removing dependencies or changing logic.
  - Max diff: ≤50 lines, ≤2 files.
  - **Allow**: `app/**`, `src/**`, `tests/**`.
- **Action**: Announce switch, proceed immediately. Must use `refactor:` commit prefix and state the cleanup benefit in the PR body.

#### Mode 1 — LTRM (Local Tooling Repair Mode)

- **Description**: Used ONLY when baseline test/typecheck fails due to local configuration issues (Jest/tsconfig/scripts).
- **Scope Rules**:
  - Temporarily **Allow**: `jest.config.*`, `tsconfig*.json`, `tests/setup*.ts`, `package.json` (scripts + devDependencies only).
  - Allow ONE devDep addition (`@swc/jest` or `ts-jest`).
  - Allow lockfile modification (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `yarn.lock`) if a devDep is added.
- **Action**: Announce switch, proceed immediately. Diff ≤120 lines, ≤2 files. Must include 3–5 line RCA in commit.

#### Mode 2 — CI_REPAIR_MODE

- **Description**: Used when workflows under `.github/**` are broken at baseline.
- **Scope Rules**:
  - Only `.github/**` is allowed.
- **Action**: Follow your CI-Repair Protocol (canary, tiny diff, pinned versions).

#### Mode 3 — Scoped Override

- **Description**: A solution necessarily touches items outside Modes 0-2 (runtime deps, root configs, infra, or large asset addition).
- **Scope Rules**:
  - Agent must request permission first using the template. Changes are limited only to paths explicitly listed in the approved request.
- **Action**: Stop. Request human approval (must receive APPROVED_OVERRIDE token).

#### Mode 4 — Emergency Freeze (Stalled Work or High Risk)

- **Description**: Risk is high, impact is unknown, ambiguity remains, or work is stalled pending human review.
- **Scope Rules**:
  - No file modifications allowed.
- **Action**: Stop. Report status and request immediate human direction.

### “Ask Permission” — Exception Request Template (Mode 3)

The agent MUST use this template when proposing a Scoped Override (Mode 3).

#### OVERRIDE REQUEST (Mode 3 — Scoped)

- **Issue**: #<NUM> — <TITLE>
- **Base ref**: <ref/branch>
- **Why override is needed (≤5 lines)**:
  - [What’s blocked, by what constraint, and why lesser modes are insufficient]

- **Options considered**:
  1. <Option A: minimal scope> — Pros/Cons, Est lines/files, Risk
  2. <Option B: alt> — Pros/Cons, Est lines/files, Risk
  3. <Option C: do nothing> — Impact

- **Proposed plan (chosen option)**:
  - Paths touched (exact, must be saved to `PROPOSED_FILES.txt`): [files]
  - Est diff: ~<lines>, <files> (Note: Diff budget applies to code/text; non-text assets are reviewed case-by-case)
  - **Dependency change:** [npm install/update/remove, or N/A]
  - **Security/License Check:** [brief summary of security review or N/A]
  - **Versioning Preference:** [State preference: Caret (^), Tilde (~), or Pinned version]
  - Rollback: `git revert <sha>` (single commit)
  - Tests added: [file]
  - Timebox: <N> hours

- **Evidence pack**:
  - Repro commands + outputs (tsc/test/build)
  - Exact failing lines (file:line)
  - Links (logs/builds)

- **APPROVAL NEEDED**:
  - Reply with: `APPROVE OVERRIDE: Mode 3 (Option X)` and I’ll proceed.

### 📋 AGENT WORK ORDER (Feature/Bug) — Flexible w/ Overrides

#### Core Policy & File Access

- **Read vs. Write**: The agent is always permitted to read any file for context, but can only modify files listed in the current approved Mode's allowlist.
- **Non-Text Assets**: Adding non-text assets (images, fonts, binaries) is not permitted in Modes 0, 0.5, 1, or 2. They require Mode 3 Scoped Override approval due to potential repo size/licensing implications.
- **Initial Mode**: Start in Mode 0 (Normal).
- **Denylist**: `.github/**`, `scripts/**`, `.env*`, `.devcontainer/**`, `.vscode/**`, `Dockerfile*`, `vercel.*`, `eslint*`, `eslint.config.*`, `prettier*`, `tsconfig*.json` (unless Mode 1), `husky/**`, `package*.json` (unless Mode 1), `pnpm-lock.yaml` (unless Mode 1), `yarn.lock` (unless Mode 1), `jest.config.*` (unless Mode 1), `babel.config.*`.
- **Diff Budget**: ≤**300** lines, ≤**4** files. No runtime deps.

#### Stale Work Policy

- **Mode 3 Blockage**: If the agent submits a Mode 3 Override Request and does not receive a response (approval or denial) within 72 hours, the agent MUST automatically switch to Mode 4 (Emergency Freeze), report the issue as Stalled, and stop work on the task.
- **Stale PR Branch**: If a Pull Request (PR) has been open for 10 days with pending requested changes or without human interaction, the agent MUST automatically switch to Mode 4 (Emergency Freeze), mark the PR as Stale, and request human re-triage or closure.

#### Continuous Improvement Mandate

- The agent is mandated to prioritize code health and process efficiency.
- **TD Identification**: During planning and implementation, the agent MUST actively look for opportunities to reduce unnecessary technical debt, improve testing (coverage/speed/clarity), or optimize development flow.
- **Scope Boundary**: If an identified improvement/bug is outside the current issue's direct scope and cannot be handled safely under Mode 0.5 (Self-Initiated Refactor), the agent MUST NOT implement the fix in the current PR.
- **New Issue Proposal**: The agent must draft a proposal for a new issue containing the scope, justification, and estimated complexity for the recommended change. This proposal must be included in the PR body for review.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0`
- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit`
- ✅ `npm test -- --runInBand` (add/adjust ≥1 unit test)
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ Behavior verified (steps in PR)
- ✅ Diff within budget & approved mode
- ✅ No scope creep beyond approved mode(s)
- ✅ Non-Functional Check 1 (Performance): No change introduces a significant performance regression (e.g., increased memory usage, blocking UI threads, or significant latency increase).
- ✅ Non-Functional Check 2 (Security): No new security vulnerabilities are introduced; all environment variables/secrets are handled via defined mechanisms, not hardcoded.
- ✅ Non-Functional Check 3 (i18n): No new user-facing strings are hardcoded in source files (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, etc.). All strings must be added using the project's standard internationalization (i18n) utility or system.

---

### Step 1 — Reproduce (Branch Setup)

- **Branching Policy**: The agent MUST create a new, distinct branch for every issue, starting with the `/ai` prefix.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch -c ai/[ISSUE_NUMBER]-[kebab]-[YYYYMMDDHHmm] [BASE_REF]

npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit || true
npm run build || true
npm test -- --runInBand || true
```

- Paste exact failures; declare Mode 1/2 need if applicable. Otherwise prepare Mode 3 request.

### Step 2 — Plan

- **Complexity Check**: If the estimated change exceeds the Mode 0 budget by more than 50% (>450 lines or >6 files), the agent must propose breaking the task into smaller, independent sub-tasks before proceeding. (See Policy on Task Decomposition).
- **Technical Debt Review**: Include any findings or New Issue Proposals from the Continuous Improvement Mandate here.
- **Files to edit/create** (exact list).
- **Assumptions** (≤3).
- **In scope** (≤3) / **Out of scope** (≤3).
- Cite relevant docs/`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` rules.

### Step 3 — Implement

- Make minimal diffs in the currently approved mode.
- Add/adjust one unit test.
- Pre-commit guard.
- Enforce allowlist/denylist & diff budget per mode.
- If APPROVED_OVERRIDE is set, ensure staged files ⊆ `PROPOSED_FILES.txt`.

- **Merge Conflict Resolution Policy**:
  - If a merge conflict is encountered during development or before staging, the agent MUST rebase the current branch against the base ref (`git rebase [BASE_REF]`).
  - The agent MUST resolve all conflicts locally and verify that all acceptance criteria still pass before committing.

- **Commit message**

  ```
  fix: [short-name] (Fixes #[ISSUE_NUMBER])
  Mode: [0|0.5 Refactor|1 LTRM|2 CI_REPAIR|3 Scoped]
  RCA: [3–5 lines]
  Minimal fix: [1–2 lines]
  Tests: [file]
  ```

### Step 4 — PR Hygiene (Review Preparation)

- Confirm no unapproved paths, all checks green, small diff + tests.
- **PR body**: What/Why/How-to-verify, Risks/Limitations, and:
  - 🧩 Conformance: Verified per `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
  - Mode used: [0|0.5|1|2|3], Reason: [short]
  - [New Issue Proposals (if applicable): Paste structured proposals here for human review.]

### Step 5 — Open PR (Non-Merging Policy)

- **PR Title Policy**: The PR title MUST start with the `/ai` prefix to ensure immediate visibility and flagging for review. Example: `/ai fix: [short-name] (Fixes #<NUM>)`
- **Merging Policy**: The agent MUST NEVER merge its own Pull Requests. All PRs require explicit human review and merging.
- **Return** PR URL, changed files list, test summary.

### Step 6 — Final Review & Handoff (Final Check)

- The agent MUST perform a final review checklist to ensure the PR is ready for human review.
- Confirm cross-link to issue is in the PR description.
- Ensure all Acceptance Criteria were met and are documented in the PR body.
- Verify all required links (logs/builds) are present in the Evidence Pack section of the PR.
- Report current CI status (e.g., "CI Pending" or "CI Green").
- Return final status and prompt the human reviewer.
