## Feature-Related Entries (Based on Codebase)

### Features

#### Image to Prompt
- Multi-model comparison (up to 5 vision models simultaneously)

- Five categories: Words/Phrases, Photography, YouTube Engagement, Thumbnails, Custom
- Importance ratings (1-10)
- Type classification (Must Have, Recommended, Optional, Avoid)
- Leonardo AI compatible syntax
- Reference image support

#### Usage Tracking
- Comprehensive API usage history
- Date range filtering
- Model-specific cost breakdown
- Per-session cost analysis
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, PDF)
- Real-time cost calculation

#### Settings Management
- Secure API key storage in localStorage
- Model selection with pinning
- Custom prompt templates
- Prompt Creator field configuration
- Cross-tab synchronization
- Export/import settings

### Technical Improvements

#### Performance
- localStorage caching with 24-hour model refresh
- Debounced settings updates
- Selective React subscriptions for optimized re-renders
- Batch processing queue with concurrency control
- Cross-tab state synchronization

#### Developer Experience
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive test coverage (â‰¥60%)
- ESLint and Prettier integration
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- React 19 and Next.js 15 support
- Turbopack build optimization

#### Architecture
- Singleton pattern for storage consistency
- Pub/sub subscriptions with selective updates
- Domain-driven folder structure
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, domain, lib)
- Type-safe API clients
- Error handling with retry logic

### Dependencies

#### Major Versions
- Next.js 15.5.4
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4

#### Key Libraries
- OpenAI SDK 6.3.0 (for OpenRouter API)
- Radix UI Tooltip 1.2.8
- Lucide React 0.545.0 (icons)
- Jest 29 (testing)
- ESLint 9 (linting)

## Security & Privacy

### Security Measures
- API keys stored only in browser localStorage
- No server-side key storage
- HTTPS-only API communication
- No user tracking or analytics
- No data transmission except to OpenRouter API

### Privacy
- All data stored locally in browser
- No cookies or persistent identifiers
- Cross-origin isolation
- Secure environment variable handling

## Breaking Changes

None identified in current documentation review. The application maintains backward compatibility with:
- Existing localStorage data structures
- API contracts
- Component interfaces

## Deprecations

### Deprecated Fields
- `AppSettings.selectedModel` - Kept for backward compatibility but replaced by `selectedVisionModels` array

## Known Issues

Based on codebase review:
- Maximum localStorage size (~10MB) may limit history size
- Maximum 1000 history entries (oldest auto-deleted)
- Model list refresh limited to once per 24 hours (performance optimization)
- Vision model support depends on OpenRouter account permissions

## Migration Notes

No migrations required for new installations. Existing installations:
- Automatically migrate from `selectedModel` to `selectedVisionModels` on first load
- History entries auto-truncate to 1000 items if exceeded
- Settings schema version checked on load for future migrations

## Future Considerations

Potential features for future releases (based on codebase patterns):
- Additional export formats (Markdown, HTML)
- Batch operation history
- Model performance analytics
- Cost budgeting and alerts
- Workspace/project organization
- Collaborative features
- API rate limit visualization
