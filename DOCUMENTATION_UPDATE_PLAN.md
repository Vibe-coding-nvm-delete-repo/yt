## üöÄ How to Get Started

### Step 1: Review the Audit
```bash
# Read the comprehensive audit
cat DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Issues

**Option A: Use the automated scripts**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/create-documentation-issues.sh
chmod +x scripts/create-documentation-issues-part2.sh

# Create issues 1-9
./scripts/create-documentation-issues.sh

# Create issues 10-15
./scripts/create-documentation-issues-part2.sh
```

**Option B: Create issues manually**
- Use the detailed issue specifications in `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`
- Copy the content for each issue
- Create via GitHub web UI or `gh issue create`

### Step 3: Start with Phase 1 (Critical User Docs)
Begin with the highest priority issues that unblock users:
1. Issue #1: README & Getting Started
2. Issue #2: User Guide
3. Issue #3: Troubleshooting & FAQ

```bash
# View all documentation issues
gh issue list --milestone "Documentation Update"

gh issue list --milestone "Documentation Update" --state closed

# View specific label
gh issue list --label "documentation,priority-critical"
```

### Update DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md
As issues are completed, update the tracking section in `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`:
```markdown

Every document must:
- [ ] Be written in clear, concise English
- [ ] Use consistent Markdown formatting
- [ ] Include table of contents for long docs (>100 lines)
- [ ] Have working links (internal and external)
- [ ] Include code examples that are tested
- [ ] Use consistent terminology
- [ ] Be reviewed by at least one other person
- [ ] Be spell-checked
- [ ] Follow the project's voice and tone
- [ ] Be accessible (clear language, good structure)

## üéì Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small, Ship Fast**
Don't try to make everything perfect. Get a good first version, publish it, then iterate based on feedback.

### 2. **Use Templates**
Copy structure from existing good docs. Many of our infrastructure docs are excellent templates.

### 3. **Include Examples**
Every concept should have at least one code example. Real examples from the codebase are best.

### 4. **Get Screenshots**
For user-facing docs, screenshots are essential. Annotate them with arrows/highlights where helpful.

### 5. **Test Everything**
Run every command, test every code example. If it doesn't work, fix it.

### 6. **Cross-Link Liberally**
Link between related docs. Make it easy to navigate the documentation.

### 7. **Update as You Go**
When you change code, update relevant docs immediately. Don't let docs drift.

### 8. **Get Reviews**
Have someone unfamiliar with the topic review your docs. If they're confused, clarify.
