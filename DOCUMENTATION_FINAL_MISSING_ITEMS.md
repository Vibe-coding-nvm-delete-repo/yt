## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

**Why I Missed These:**

1. **Browser Compatibility** - Assumed modern browsers, didn't think about compatibility matrix
2. **Accessibility** - Not visible in code structure, requires dedicated thinking
3. **Dependencies** - Too obvious, overlooked documenting "why"
4. **Performance** - No explicit benchmarks in code, assumed not needed
5. **Limitations** - P0_KNOWN_ISSUES.md exists but needs integration
6. **Data Schema** - Version fields exist but no migration docs
7. **Roadmap** - Future-looking, not current-state
8. **Examples** - Not documentation per se, but critical for learning

**Professional Documentation Standards Include:**
- ✅ User guides
- ✅ Developer guides
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ Architecture docs
- ✅ **Compatibility matrices** ⭐
- ✅ **Accessibility statements** ⭐
- ✅ **Dependency documentation** ⭐
- ✅ **Performance baselines** ⭐
