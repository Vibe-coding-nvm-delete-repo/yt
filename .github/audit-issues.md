# Codebase Health Audit – Issues

## [Audit] Improve Testing & Coverage – Increase Suite Depth and Mock Reliability

🧾 Finding: Current test coverage is moderate (3 suites run, 13 tests total) with mocked API calls but lacks coverage for edge case flows like concurrent requests, partial failures, or real network errors. Legacy manual scripts are ignored, and no integration tests exist for end-to-end workflows.  
💡 Recommendation: Migrate legacy test scripts to Jest, add integration tests for upload→generate→persist flow using testing-library, and expand unit tests for storage error paths and API retries. Introduce coverage reporting and aim for 80%+ branch coverage.  
🎯 Impact: Reduces risk of regression in core flows, speeds debugging by providing reliable tests for frequent bug areas, and enables confident refactoring without manual QA.  
📊 Current Score: 6/10 → Target: 9/10  
🏷️ Priority: P2

## [Audit] Improve Documentation – Add Developer Guides and API Contracts

🧾 Finding: README exists but lacks API docs, architecture overviews, or setup/troubleshooting guides. Inline comments are sparse, error conventions undefined, and onboarding requires codebase exploration. No CHANGELOG or developer docs for error handling, hooks, or storage layers.  
💡 Recommendation: Add ARCHITECTURE.md with component diagrams, API contract docs (e.g., OpenRouter endpoint validations), developer guide for error-handling patterns and testing mocks. Include inline docs for complex funcs like useSettings and storage classes.  
🎯 Impact: Reduces ramp-up time for new developers, clarifies implicit contracts (like error shapes), and prevents divergent implementations by documenting conventions upfront.  
📊 Current Score: 4/10 → Target: 9/10  
🏷️ Priority: P3

## Final Health Score: 7.25/10

Summary: Well-structured TypeScript/Next.js project with excellent tooling and code quality. Main opportunities: expand testing depth, add developer docs, finish API validation improvements.
