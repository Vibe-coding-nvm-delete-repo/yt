## üö® Critical Missing Features (P0)

### 1. **Data Export/Import Functionality**

**Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Why Essential:**

- Users have NO way to backup their data
- All data is localStorage-only (can be lost on browser clear)
- No migration path between browsers/devices
- No way to preserve work if localStorage quota is exceeded

**Current State:**

- Usage history: localStorage only
- Prompt history: localStorage only
- Best practices library: localStorage only
- Settings: localStorage only
- Prompt creator configuration: localStorage only

**What's Needed:**

```typescript
// Essential functionality:
- Export all data to JSON file (single click)
- Import data from JSON file
- Merge strategies (replace, merge, skip duplicates)
- Export individual sections (usage, history, settings, etc.)
- Validation on import to prevent corruption
```

**Files to Create:**

- `src/lib/dataExport.ts` - Export logic with validation
- `src/lib/dataImport.ts` - Import logic with merge strategies
- `src/components/settings/DataManagement.tsx` - UI for export/import
- Add to Settings tab as new section "Data Management"

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] One-click export of all data as JSON
- [ ] One-click import with validation
- [ ] Merge strategy selection (replace/merge/skip)
- [ ] Export individual data sections
- [ ] Import preview before applying
- [ ] Data validation prevents corruption
- [ ] Clear success/error messaging
