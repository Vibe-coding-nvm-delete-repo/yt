## Summary

‚úÖ Removed Import/Export Settings feature completely as requested in #134

- Removed UI components from SettingsTab.tsx (Import/Export section with buttons)
- Removed storage methods (`importSettings()` and `exportSettings()`) from storage.ts
- Removed associated test for `importSettings()` from storage.test.ts
- Cleaned up unused icon imports (Download, Upload) from SettingsTab.tsx

## What changed

**Files Modified (137 lines removed across 3 files):**

- `src/components/SettingsTab.tsx`: **-70 lines**
  - Removed Download and Upload icon imports
  - Removed `exportSettings()` callback function (16 lines)
  - Removed `importSettings()` callback function (23 lines)
  - Removed entire "Import/Export Settings" UI section (31 lines)
  - Removed dependencies from renderApiKeysTab callback
- `src/lib/storage.ts`: **-44 lines**
  - Removed `importSettings()` method (37 lines)
  - Removed `exportSettings()` method (7 lines)
- `src/lib/__tests__/storage.test.ts`: **-23 lines**
  - Removed `importSettings()` test case

## Why

The Import/Export Settings feature was deemed unnecessary per issue #134. The feature allowed users to export their settings to a JSON file and import them back, but this functionality is not needed for the application. All other settings functionality (API key management, model selection, custom prompts) remains intact.

## How to verify

1. **Check out this branch and run:**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Start the app and navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys tab**
3. **Verify the "Import/Export Settings" section is no longer visible**
4. **Verify all other settings functionality still works:**
   - API key input and validation
   - Model fetching and selection
   - Custom prompt editing
   - All other tabs function normally

## Risks / Limitations

**Pre-existing Issues (NOT introduced by this PR):**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test suite has configuration issue (ts-jest preset not installed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 pre-existing lint warnings in other files (ImageToPromptTab.tsx, batchQueue.ts, retry.ts)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some TypeScript errors in test files (SettingsTab.simple.test.tsx)

**Impact:**

- ‚úÖ **Low risk** - purely removal of unused feature
- ‚úÖ **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ **All other settings features remain intact**
- ‚úÖ **No runtime dependencies added or modified**

## Size

**137 lines removed** across 3 files

- src/components/SettingsTab.tsx: -70 lines
- src/lib/storage.ts: -44 lines
- src/lib/**tests**/storage.test.ts: -23 lines

## üß© Conformance & Verification

**Mode used:** 0 (Normal)  
**Reason:** Standard feature removal within allowed scope (src/\*\*)
