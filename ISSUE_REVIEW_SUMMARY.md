npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest
# Fix jest.config.js typo
npm test -- --runInBand
```

### For DevOps (Plan for Weeks 3-6)

---

## üö® Critical Risks

### High-Risk Items

1. **#181** - DOM refactoring could break functionality
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, manual QA
2. **#126-127** - Auto-filing could spam issues
   - **Mitigation:** Rate limiting (‚â§10/day), dry-run mode

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **#187** - Hooks changes could alter behavior
   - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing, code review
2. **#137** - Feature scope could expand
   - **Mitigation:** Clear MVP requirements

---

## üí° Key Recommendations

### 1. Start Immediately with Critical Fixes

The three critical issues (#182, #180, #181) are **blocking development workflow**. These should be fixed TODAY.

### 2. Batch Quick Wins

Issues #183, #184, #185, #189 can be completed in a single 1.5-hour session and combined into one PR.

### 3. Assign by Expertise

- **Critical Fixes:** Mid-level React/TypeScript developer
- **Quick Wins:** Junior developer (good learning opportunity)
- **PQA Infrastructure:** Senior DevOps engineer
- **Features:** Full-stack developer

### 4. Parallel Work Opportunities

- Week 1: One dev on critical fixes, another preparing docs
- Week 2: One dev on quality issues, another on quick wins
- Weeks 3+: DevOps on PQA, feature dev on #137

### 5. Documentation Updates Required

As issues are resolved, update:

- `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/PQA_POLICY.md` (after Phase 4)
